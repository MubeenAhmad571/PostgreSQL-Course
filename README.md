 * SQL stands for Structured Query Language. Also referred to as sequel by tech professionals.
 * SQL is the standard language used to access, communicate, manpulate and interact with databases.
 * SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986.
 * SQL became a standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.
 * SQL has differernt versions Implemented by various relational database management systems (RDBMS). **Example:** Microsoft SQL Server version is called Transact-SQL (T-SQL). 
 * SQL versions must be compliant with ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.
 * Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard.

 ### What is PostgreSQL?

* PostgreSQL is pronouced "post-gres".So if you hear people saying postgres, they mean PostgreSQL.
* This basically is a relational database management system, just like Oracle or Microsoft as server or things like mySQL. So it has basically the same features and functionalities of a relational database management system.
* It also complies to ANSI. ANSI basically is the American National Standards Institute for SQL, which is a structural query language. So it also conforms to the standards. So the sequel you use for the Postgres database also follows the ANSI standard. So there are certain ways you write SQL statements that is applicable to all relational databases.
* Postgres is a general purpose database management system, so you can use it basically for a variety of things.
* It is also object relational, so it is known as an object relational database management system.
* It is free and open source by open source. That means people can contribute to make it better.
* It is also a platform independent. What that means is that you can install it on a Windows platform Mac platform, a Unix platform source platform independent is not pegged to one platform, so you can use it across multiple platforms.
* It is stable and requires minimum maintenance. So most applications that uses the Postgres database, you don't really need to spend a lot of time in the maintenance because the database itself is quite stable.
* The database has large storage. It also has a good performance is fast, it is extensible. Basically what that means is that you can define your own data types, index types. You can also create your own custom plug ins.The support for the Postgres is quite substantial.
